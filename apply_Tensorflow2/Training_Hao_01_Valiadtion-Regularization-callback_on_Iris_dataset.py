# # Programming Assignment

# ## Model validation on the Iris dataset

# ### Instructions
# 
# In this notebook, you will build, compile and fit a neural network model to the Iris dataset. You will also implement validation, regularisation and callbacks to improve your model.
# 
# Some code cells are provided you in the notebook. You should avoid editing provided code, and make sure to execute the cells in order to avoid unexpected errors. Some cells begin with the line: 
# 
# `#### GRADED CELL ####`
# 
# Don't move or edit this first line - this is what the automatic grader looks for to recognise graded cells. These cells require you to write your own code to complete them, and are automatically graded when you submit the notebook. Don't edit the function name or signature provided in these cells, otherwise the automatic grader might not function properly. Inside these graded cells, you can use any functions or classes that are imported below, but make sure you don't use any variables that are outside the scope of the function.
# 
# ### How to submit
# 
# Complete all the tasks you are asked for in the worksheet. When you have finished and are happy with your code, press the **Submit Assignment** button at the top of this notebook.
# 
# ### Let's get started!
# 
# We'll start running some imports, and loading the dataset. Do not edit the existing imports in the following cell. If you would like to make further Tensorflow imports, you should add them here.

# In[1]:


#### PACKAGE IMPORTS ####

# #### The Iris dataset
# 
# In this assignment, you will use the [Iris dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html). It consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. For a reference, see the following papers:
# 
# - R. A. Fisher. "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems". Annals of Eugenics. 7 (2): 179â€“188, 1936.
# 
# Your goal is to construct a neural network that classifies each sample into the correct class, as well as applying validation and regularisation techniques.

# #### Load and preprocess the data
# 
# First read in the Iris dataset using `datasets.load_iris()`, and split the dataset into training and test sets.

# Complete the following function. 
# Make sure to not change the function name or arguments.

    This function takes the Iris dataset as loaded by sklearn.datasets.load_iris(), and then

    making up the remaining 10%.
    Your function should return a tuple (train_data, test_data, train_targets, test_targets) 
    of appropriately split training and test data and targets.

# #### Build the neural network model
# 

# You can now construct a model to fit to the data. Using the Sequential API, build your model according to the following specifications:
# 
# * The model should use the `input_shape` in the function argument to set the input size in the first layer.
# * The first layer should be a dense layer with 64 units.
# * The weights of the first layer should be initialised with the He uniform initializer.
# * The biases of the first layer should be all initially equal to one.
# * There should then be a further four dense layers, each with 128 units.
# * This should be followed with four dense layers, each with 64 units.
# * All of these Dense layers should use the ReLU activation function.
# * The output Dense layer should have 3 units and the softmax activation function.
# 
# In total, the network should have 10 layers.
